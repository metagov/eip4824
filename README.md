## EIP-4824 

### Introduction to EIP-4824

EIP-4824 addresses the challenge of collecting and standardizing essential DAO metadata. With over 20,000 DAOs spread across various blockchains, governance frameworks, and operational structures, consolidating this data has become a complex task. The metadata needed to understand a DAO's structure, proposals, members, contracts, and activities is often scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult to access and manage.

EIP-4824 introduces a standardized way to handle DAO metadata using a `daoURI`, which is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that points to a DAO's metadata.

### Publishing DAO URIs 

One effective method for publishing and managing DAO URIs is using a GitHub repository. 

Here are the instructions for it, [Instructions.md](instructions.md)
